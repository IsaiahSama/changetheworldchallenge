        <h2>The Collective Social Brain Hypothesis</h2>
        <p>The Collective Social Brain hypothesis posits that individuals strongly tend to fall into one of two groups when reasoning about social protection and provision. One group identifies with vulnerable populations and believes the solution is to provide more rights and protections. The other group tends to believe the solution is through personal responsibility.</p>
        <p>The reasoning style of the first group relies on Type I (intuitive) reasoning, which is effective in solving uncomputable problems through pattern recognition. In contrast, the second group uses Type II (logical) reasoning, which is methodical and better suited to computable problems where a solution can be deduced through logic.</p>
        <p>This distinction between reasoning styles has implications for social polarization, particularly during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, where different groups arrived at opposing conclusions regarding lockdown measures.</p>
        <p>Switching between these two reasoning styles can be difficult in larger groups, which is where a General Collective Intelligence (GCI) platform could enhance group decision-making by providing a mechanism for switching between these styles. This has profound implications for solving global challenges like climate change and poverty.</p>
