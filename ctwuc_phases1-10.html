    <h1>The Change the World University Challenge (Phases 1-10)</h1>
    <p>The “Change the World University Challenge” will offer a prize to the team that is able to use the principles of General Collective Intelligence to design a network of interventions with the greatest predicted impact on the specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targeted by the challenge. 

Each year of the challenge will target the goals of a different phase of a proposed ten phase Collective Intelligence based Program to Accelerate Achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (CIPAA-SDGs program). The program’s initial phases aim to roll out across 15 CARICOM member states, starting with:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="">Phase I: Elevating agricultural livelihoods.</a></li>
        <li><a href="">Phase II: Enhancing access to essential services like employment, healthcare, education, and renewable energy.</a></li>
        <li><a href="">Phase III: Advancing sustainable housing in smart cities.</a></li>
    </ul>

Patterns of network effects through which impact on the SDGs per program dollar might be vastly or even exponentially increased have been identified. Just like a petri dish full of a billion single-celled organisms can’t reliably organize into the billion cells of a bird to cooperatively solve the problem of flight, orchestrating cooperation to do this is currently not reliably within the reach of human groups.

It is envisioned that a federated intelligence tool in which each individual is represented by their own intelligent agent could be created to help organize teams to come together to do this. The CC4CI will work to raise funding for researchers interested in federated intelligence who want to build this as a test case.</p>
