        <h2>Welcome to the Change the World University Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            The Change the World University Challenge is an innovative and
            transformative contest designed to engage university students in
            addressing some of the most pressing global challenges of our time. The
            contest encourages participants to explore groundbreaking concepts such
            as <strong>collective intelligence</strong>, the
            <strong>technology gravity well</strong>, and the
            <strong>collective social brain hypothesis</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through this challenge, students will have the opportunity to propose
            creative solutions that harness the power of collective intelligence to
            tackle issues like economic inequality, climate change, and
            technological disruption. By participating, youâ€™ll not only contribute
            to solving real-world problems but also gain recognition for your
            innovative thinking and collaborate with like-minded individuals from
            around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            The challenge begins with an essay contest open to students across all
            departments, inviting them to explore these critical topics. The best
            essays will be showcased to a global audience, and winners will receive
            exciting rewards, including recognition from leading academics and
            industry professionals.
