<h1>Problems Currently Not Reliably Solvable by Human Groups</h1>
<p>Many critical challenges we face today cannot be reliably solved by human groups alone. These challenges are especially impactful because they hinder our ability to collectively address some of humanity’s most pressing issues. Below are several key problems that exemplify this difficulty:</p>
<h2>1. The General Collective Intelligence Imperative</h2>
<p>Some challenges require a level of sustained reasoning and resource investment that exceeds the capacity or willingness of most groups. Typically, centralized entities such as corporations, governments, or individuals provide the necessary support. However, these entities often prioritize self-interest over collective well-being, leading to less effective solutions. The goal is to create a decentralized collective intelligence system that can self-organize, marshal resources, and direct them toward solving large-scale, complex problems in a way that benefits everyone.</p>
<h2>2. The Semantic Liquidity Problem (The "Innovation Deployment Problem")</h2>
<p>A complete semantic representation—a system enabling seamless communication and understanding across different fields—is critical for unlocking collaboration and innovation across diverse domains. However, achieving the necessary critical mass for widespread deployment is a significant hurdle. Without broad adoption, the potential of this representation to transform interdisciplinary collaboration and accelerate innovation remains untapped.</p>
<h2>3. The Cognitive Liquidity Problem (The "Cognitive Desert Problem")</h2>
<p>Cognitive deserts are regions or areas where innovative ideas and disruptive thinking fail to emerge due to a lack of resources or engagement. In these cognitive deserts, even the most groundbreaking ideas can remain unnoticed, preventing their application to solve existential problems. The challenge is to foster environments that encourage the emergence and recognition of innovative ideas across all sectors.</p>
<h2>4. The Innovation Stagnation Dilemma</h2>
<p>While large language models (LLMs) can be valuable tools, they also pose a risk of reinforcing consensus-driven thinking, overwhelming review processes with excessive content, and ultimately stifling innovation. This reliance on LLMs can create feedback loops that prioritize conformity over originality, limiting the potential for groundbreaking discoveries and new ways of thinking.</p>
<p>The Change the World University Challenge seeks to build awareness and inspire action around these and other pressing issues, encouraging participants to explore bold new ideas and solutions.</p>
