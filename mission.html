    <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
    <p>The Change the World University Challenge seeks to ignite innovative thinking and inspire action by engaging students and academic communities to explore cutting-edge ideas such as collective intelligence, the technology gravity well, and the collective social brain hypothesis. Through this initiative, we aim to create the widespread awareness of the problems that can’t reliably be solved without augmenting our collective intelligence, and we aim to generate the public support required to incentivize governments to implement the collective intelligence based interventions that can radically increase our collective ability to address pressing global challenges—such as economic inequality, climate change, and technological displacement—by fostering intellectual discourse and collaboration. By empowering participants to design solutions grounded in collective intelligence, the challenge aspires to create awareness about the possibility of deploying self-sustaining systems that accelerate sustainable development, beginning in the Caribbean and expanding globally. This initiative underscores the belief that, by working together smarter, we can create solutions that elevate societies, reduce inequality, and ensure a prosperous future for all.</p>
